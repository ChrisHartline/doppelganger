    "answer": "On the Joint Staff I had to ship over one-hundred laptops to Germany overnight.

So I learned that I can no longer be technically ignorant. That's when I started learning tech."

And truthfully, none of the Colonel positions interested me. I would have really locked myself into the Army for another eight years, trading prestige - the rank - for professioanl growth."
